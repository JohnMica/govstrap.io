> Govstrap.io is a port of the GOV.UK standard web theme to the Bootstrap framework

Govstrap.io is a port of the GOV.UK standard web theme to the Bootstrap framework which allows developers with working knowledge of Bootstrap to build GOV.UK related sites without learning the details of the GDS methods. This software enables the developer to take advantage of the significant investments made by GDS in accessibility and device compatibility by re-using the GDS theme.

The code was created as a by-product of the Summer 2016 http://code4health.org website update and subsequently released for re-use by others, therefore all code created for the govstrap.io project is available as Open Source software.

Please keep in mind this project is still beta, meaning things may not be working as expected or will be changed in future updates and may have some broken links whilst we develop the site.


This repo contains the http://govstrap.io website code and examples.

The site is created using apache SSI to simplify editing and management of the site. govstrap.io has also been integrated in to the http://flexibase.io CMS platform.
